# Dockerized NLP tools for Polish

This repository contains a (somewhat dirty, but convenient) Dockerfile which builds an image with some of the [WrocUT](http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/en/) NLP tools - most notably [wcrft2](http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/redmine/projects/wcrft/wiki/) and all of its dependencies. The bash scripts are a modified (non-interactive) version of the installation script intended for Ubuntu 12.04 found [here](http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/redmine/projects/skrypt-instalujacy-narzedzia-nlp/wiki).

I'm not the author of either the tools or the bash scripts.
